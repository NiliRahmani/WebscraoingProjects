IMDB Web Scraping Project

This is a simple webscarping project, I utilized Python and BeautifulSoup to extract information on the top 250 movies from the IMDB website. I successfully retrieved data such as movie names, release years, ranks, and ratings. Finally, I saved the extracted data into an Excel file named 'IMDB Movie Ratings'.
