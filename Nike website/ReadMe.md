**Project Description**

This project focuses on extracting T-shirt items and their associated data using Selenium. The code extracts the necessary information and saves it in an Excel file, while also downloading and saving the corresponding images on the local machine.

**Prerequisites**

Before running the scripts, please ensure that you have the following:

Chrome browser installed on your machine.
Chrome Webdriver set up. The path to the Chrome Webdriver file should be provided at the specified line in the code for proper execution.

**Usage**

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Set up the Chrome Webdriver and provide the path in the code.
Run the scripts to extract the T-shirt items and data.
The extracted text data will be saved in an Excel file.
The corresponding images will be downloaded and saved on your machine.
In the Excel file, there is a column labeled 'Path to the Image' that indicates the local path on the original author's PC. You can modify this column based on your desired local path.
